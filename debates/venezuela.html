00:00:18 Moderator: Hello everyone. Thank you all for coming out to hear this amazing conversation on Venezuela. A little backstory on this: This started just after the US forces were able to seize and arrest Nicholas Maduro for his crimes and bring him to justice in the United States. We've had a little bit of disagreement between Anthony and Will on this topic. We thought it would be appropriate because we are all here on the same side. We're all part of the same movement. We're all here to achieve the same goals. As young people, as College Republicans, we need to have the conversations on what's best for the nation, what's best for us, and how we should move forward. So I'm going to turn it over to Will and Anthony and we're going to open up the conversation on: are United States actions against Venezuela justified? Are they good? And should we be following the Monroe Doctrine? Anthony, you want to start us off?

00:01:22 Anthony Cacciato: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for having us here today to discuss this. Like you said, I think it's important that we have conversations about these sorts of things. It's important for us to remember that we can disagree and be on the same side. Senator Doug brought this up earlier, that we can agree with each other 80% of the time, but if we disagree 20% of the time, it doesn't mean that we're 20% enemies. So I think this is a healthy sort of thing that allows us to figure out what the best path forward is. Ultimately, at the end of the day, we want what's best for not only our country but also our generation.

00:01:58 Anthony Cacciato: To elaborate on something you said there. We had this conversation that arose right after the events of what happened in Venezuela and Will had spoken on the issue and pushed back just a little bit. We had a little bit of a back and forth, but I like to think of this as a full-circle moment for us to have an offline conversation, move past the character limit, and hopefully have some good insights on what's going on right now in the world and what really is the America First way forward. If you would like to bring us into it, I know you have some historical analysis you wanted to provide.

00:02:41 Will Donaghue: Yeah, I think this kind of dialogue is really important. The thing about X and social media that makes it so caustic is it's one of those things where the algorithm rewards being a little more edgy. It also rewards being a little more angry. So I think that these types of discussions amongst conservatives are going to be the way forward, especially for our generation. It's figuring out our political ideology and what we want to do and how we want to run the country going forward.

00:03:13 Will Donaghue: Just a brief overview, how many people are scholars of the 18th, 19th, and 20th-century foreign policy in the United States? Is this something we're interested in?

00:03:25 Moderator: Yeah, a few hands in the back. Very good.

00:03:30 Will Donaghue: We will get into it a little bit later, but the trajectory of the United States foreign policy changed quite a bit after the start of the Cold War, 1947-ish. That is when we transitioned from implementing the Monroe Doctrine to more of an interventionist and what eventually became a preemptive strike-first type of foreign policy where the CIA became much more involved. We got away from what made America the greatest empire the world has ever known and we became a bully and ended up hurting a lot of countries and hurt our reputation on the world stage. I think Donald Trump has done a great job bringing us back to the Monroe Doctrine. I think that is the path forward.

00:04:25 Anthony Cacciato: I'm interested in your takes on Venezuela. It was not a good operation. This is part of the disagreement we had.

00:04:32 Will Donaghue: I'm a big fan of Venezuela over here. It was decisive. We got what we wanted done. I thought it was a perfect application. Actually, before we get into it, who is familiar with the Monroe Doctrine? Did everybody learn about this? Okay. Good. Not sure if they teach this in United States history anymore. They're more likely to teach lesbian dance theory than actual US history. But I'm not surprised that this crowd is falling for... go ahead.

00:05:00 Anthony Cacciato: Yeah. So there are a couple of things to dissect there. Just to preface before really getting into this, I think we do both agree that having a free Venezuela, one that's free from the horrors of socialism and having a country that is able to operate on free-market principles and have self-determination, is desirable. We want that. I don't think that anyone in this room would be opposed to the idea of a free Venezuelan people, but I think we have to really dig into the issues that come into play when we're talking about: how do you get there?

00:05:35 Anthony Cacciato: And whether or not it's our responsibility, be it on the other side of the Caribbean or the other side of the Atlantic, to be the agents of change to create those sorts of free societies. I think we can look at Iraq for example. We invaded Iraq and between that and Afghanistan, there was a congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). And that is one of the important linchpins of what exactly happened a couple of weeks ago.

00:06:09 Anthony Cacciato: Whether or not you agree with the foreign policy of intervening in other countries to pursue potentially desirable goals, you have to do it by the Constitution. I know that we have a history in our country of fairly successful interventions in our own hemisphere. But we're not a country of "whatever the last guy did." We're a country of laws and words in the Constitution. And the Authorization for Use of Military Force is something that's importantly vested within the legislative branch.

00:06:42 Anthony Cacciato: You know, yes, we have the Commander-in-Chief who is in charge of our armed forces. But a system which has checks and balances requires the input of the people who are most connected to our populace. It's going to be our elected representatives in the legislature. So I think that was something that primarily concerned me when I looked at Venezuela. Beyond what we will likely talk about in terms of the efficacy of doing those sorts of interventions and what that will result in. But first, we really need to dig into whether or not we're abiding by the principles that we should be when we're operating our government.

00:07:22 Will Donaghue: Yeah, I agree with you entirely. I think separation of powers is very important. The legislature, though, has implemented policy to allow the President, in matters relating to national security or execution of our police power and law enforcement, to engage in limited strikes against opponents abroad. The left and the right have used this for drone strikes and assassinations multiple times.

00:07:58 Will Donaghue: And this can't be a campaign, by the way, right? It cannot be a drawn-out campaign. That obviously requires congressional approval. The President does have the authority in limited circumstances to go in to bomb people, to assassinate world leaders, or abduct them in the dead of night, which is what we did to Maduro quite effectively. By the way, I think this was a very clean execution of the President's police authority. This was enforcement action. It is not an act of war. Maduro was not a legitimate leader to begin with and his actions in pushing these drug cartels really have led to the deaths of potentially millions of Americans. It is a law enforcement action. So I'm not concerned with the United States marching in with a couple of Blackhawk helicopters and abducting a criminal.

00:08:51 Anthony Cacciato: Yeah. And I'll lean back on again saying: is Maduro definitely responsible and liable for a lot of the crimes against American people, against people of his own country? Absolutely. I think that needs to be put to rest immediately. But the issue then lies in: to what extent does the United States have jurisdiction to perform law enforcement tasks outside of its own legal jurisdiction?

00:09:21 Will Donaghue: Unlimited. And why exactly is it unlimited? Because the United States is the greatest guarantee of peace in the entire world. If the world starts acting against the interests of the United States, it is the President's duty to act against it.

00:09:39 Anthony Cacciato: And where do you base that sort of duty, that sense of responsibility on the part of the leader of the United States to engage in police action outside of its own personal jurisdiction?

00:09:53 Will Donaghue: "The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States."

00:09:59 Anthony Cacciato: So the executive power is vested within the President, yes, but within its own legal jurisdiction of the country. Whatever maritime bounds we have. Yes, that is kind of the furthest extent of American legal jurisdiction, but I think we're wandering into the territory of: do we have legal jurisdiction in another country? Is that something you would argue is the case?

00:10:22 Will Donaghue: I think a better question is: what is jurisdiction? Now you're getting... what is jurisdiction about? What is force? What is coercion? These questions are matters of international law, international criminal law. The truth of the matter is the only thing that matters in the state of nature, the law of nations, is the use of force. There is no country on the planet that can compete with the United States military. If right now Canada or Greenland were to stand up to the United States, they would be rolled over in a matter of minutes. There is nothing anyone in Europe or Russia or China could do to stop us short of a nuclear bomb. Therefore, the United States is the ultimate jurisdiction over the entire world.

00:11:17 Will Donaghue: And the sooner that we realize that as an empire, the sooner we will realize that we can secure American peace without the need for death or long engagements. These people... there are 57,000 people in Europe who think they can send 30 troops and they're going to threaten us. They can't do anything. What is law? Law is words on a piece of paper that are written down that we mutually assure through the use of force. What are they going to do? What are treaties? Treaties are just an agreement that they're going to do something. We are not signatories on the International Criminal Court for a reason. We do not want to be bound by criminal law at the international level because the only person that could enforce the law against us is us. They tried to drag George Bush to the International Criminal Court. He said no. And they couldn't do anything about it. There's a reason for that. And so yes, ultimately the jurisdiction of the entire world is the United States' jurisdiction.

00:12:27 Anthony Cacciato: So a couple of things. I think that we can put to rest any sort of considerations about international law. I think we both agreed that in terms of actually being a binding force against the United States, that's neither something that's practicable nor is it something that's potentially in line with recognizing the Constitution as the supreme authority to which American elected officials are responsible.

00:12:53 Anthony Cacciato: But I think it's interesting to consider the precedent of what's being set by operating on that framework. It's interesting you brought up the reason behind why we had the Monroe Doctrine. It would be revisionist to assume that the Monroe Doctrine operated as a carte blanche for the United States to have overlordship over the Western Hemisphere. It was an intentionality to exclude European powers, who at that time were still operating as colonial empires, from influencing countries on our end of the hemisphere. Ultimately because there was a value in self-determination. Something that we fought for, strove for, and ultimately something that I think is inherent to how our foreign policy was conducted in the Western Hemisphere. For us to presume that we have authority over them simply by virtue of the fact that we have a military that's able to enforce it, I think we end up in some dangerous moral territory.

00:14:17 Will Donaghue: I'm not concerned with the moral territory. The ultimate moral territory that matters for the American people and for the American government is the security of the American people. We are America First. The rest of the world is full of great people. We can have strategic partnerships. I think strategic partnerships are important, but the ultimate security of the American people is the only thing that matters. And so if we are talking about the moral decay of invading a country by force in order to secure their boundaries so that China and Russia—but especially China—are kept out... China is all over Central and South America. They own ports, they own mines, they own waterways, strategic routes. The Cuban Missile Crisis was such a big deal because of Cuba's proximity to Miami. This is a danger to the American people and it's why Greenland is so critical of an asset. Their strategic position for Russia makes it so that not having Greenland under control is a danger and threat to the American people. So ultimately, I'm not concerned about the morality of going in and pushing around third-world nations, especially in our hemisphere, if it means that the security of the American people is preserved.

00:15:42 Anthony Cacciato: So, leaning into the concerns about being America First and securing American interests so far as it concerns the safety of our people. Looking at Venezuela, yes, we removed Maduro and he's out of the way, but his Vice President is now in charge of the country. We may not be entirely privy to what exactly is going on behind the scenes, but what do you think enforcing our interests in Venezuela looks like? I think we need to be wary of the fact that President Trump did say that he was not afraid of boots on the ground when it came to enforcing our interests and pursuing the restoration of American private property as it related to oil rigs in Venezuela.

00:16:33 Anthony Cacciato: I think a lot of us are a little too young to really bear the full mental awareness of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we sent American servicemen and service women abroad to enforce our interests and in the process, what have we gotten out of it? The Taliban's in control of Afghanistan and thousands of American service members left dead in the process. Do we really think it's America First to pursue a policy of sending our men and women abroad in search of trying to protect American companies' interests in Venezuela or securing our hemisphere?

00:17:14 Will Donaghue: So, I agree with like 80% of what you said there, but I think there's a couple of terms we need to hash out. I'd like to go briefly through the history of our foreign policy. Up until about 1947... the Spanish-American War obviously was to protect Cuba, ended up giving us Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. You had the Banana Wars that came after Roosevelt. There were five wars in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. These Banana Wars were in order to secure American goods: sugar, bananas, coffee. Highly successful on-the-ground military operations. And I think the military operation invasion part of that is actually very important and overlooked in a lot of these discussions.

00:18:14 Will Donaghue: 1947 changed because the Cold War shifted the focus away from American interest to basically freeing people from communism. That was driven from a period of people very scared of fascism and communism. Once fascism was defeated, communism became the big boogeyman. The attempt was just to push us away from communism. It pushed us away from American interventionism for the sake of purely American interests. That led to a long 30-year history of terrible conflicts. You know, we had the Bay of Pigs failure. And by the way, that Cold War era failure was entirely driven by the CIA.

00:19:00 Will Donaghue: This is where the difference really starts. It started with projects in Iran where we overthrew and instituted the Shah. It was a horrible, messy operation that ended up leading to Khomeini being put into power. That was a serious failure. The CIA failed eight different times in order to assassinate Castro. And then there was the Guatemala Civil War that we ended up starting because the CIA got involved. All these covert operations in the Cold War era where the CIA came in and was like, "Oh, we're going to go into Chile." Well, now you get Pinochet, right? You tried this again in Nicaragua with the Contras and you start another civil war. Every single time the CIA tried this, they miserably failed.

00:19:55 Will Donaghue: We got smarter on two occasions: in 1983 and 1989. One was in Grenada. The Grenada invasion looked very similar to the Venezuelan invasion. Very swift. We took over quickly. Highly successful. And the other one, which is largely regarded as the greatest conservative victory, was in Panama in '89. Again a military ground invasion. CIA was not involved. Swift takeover, American interests were secure. That is what we need to be doing.

00:20:30 Will Donaghue: For whatever reason after 1989 with the Clinton administration, we decided to go back to our old habits. With the Cold War, the CIA got involved and we did massive ground invasions. The Gulf Wars were a colossal mistake. Iraq was a massive failure. Afghanistan was a massive failure. Libya was a massive failure. All of these decisions in the 90s and early 2000s to go abroad and try to implement our regimes in countries that were not built for democracy was a colossal mistake. So, we're in agreement here. But that is not the application of the Monroe Doctrine that we're talking about. Going to the sand and having long engagements trying to implement democracies where they're not going to work proved time and time again to fail. We cannot do this again.

00:21:28 Will Donaghue: I think that is a very distinct thing from a Monroe Doctrine application where you've got a swift, decisive movement to take over a country, restore order for the sake of American dominance in our hemisphere. That's what separates Kuwait and Iraq from Panama and Venezuela. Panama and Venezuela were swift operations conducted to secure the Western Hemisphere versus overseas interests that, to be honest with you, really were not American interests at all. They were part of Israel's war plan. After 9/11 I think there was a significant American interest. We went in, we broke up ISIS. As soon as we achieved that, the job was done. And had we left after that, I think it would have been regarded as a successful operation. But instead, we decided to stay to secure Israel's interests and that was a colossal failure on behalf of the United States.

00:22:23 Will Donaghue: But the ultimate argument there is that those were not American interests. Our fights in the Middle East were not American interests and those were horrible wars. We spent trillions of dollars and wasted countless thousands of American boys for no reason. And so that is where Paleoconservatism really pushes back against the Neoconservatism policy of foreign intervention. I do not believe in foreign intervention if it does not serve American interests, especially if it is outside.

00:22:57 Anthony Cacciato: So, looking at Venezuela specifically, you can look at what happened in Panama saying, "Hey, that worked." I think maybe it's just by virtue of the fact that we were two weeks out from the actual operation. We don't really know much of what's behind the scenes on it. You know, you look at what happened and yes, we removed Maduro, but his VP is in charge there. To what extent we have influence over this VP is unclear. To me, it seems like: what is the plan? Did we go in with a plan? If so, what does that plan end up looking like?

00:23:37 Anthony Cacciato: When we go in with an unsteady plan, what we risk is having to do that sort of stabilization work, which is what we ended up doing in the Middle East. I think that's one of the biggest concerns that people have, is that we do end up with boots on the ground. I think that even if we end up in a situation where we're not deploying an excessive amount of men and women to the area, we're still going to end up with that concern whether it's a peacekeeping force of 300 people or 3,000 people because ultimately you can't govern by predator drone. You're not going to be able to enforce these interests without putting men and women down on the ground. I am highly doubtful that we do have collaboration to a sufficient extent with the Venezuelan regime and that is where the biggest problem comes into asking: well, what's next?

00:24:28 Moderator: If I can jump in real quick, I think there's obviously still a lot left that we don't know. We're not in the rooms. We don't see these conversations taking place and what the full plan is, what the full outcome will be. So, I think that's actually a great place where we could leave this discussion where we understand both of your perspectives behind it. And we have about five minutes left. So, if you guys are open to taking one or two questions from the audience, we could do that as well.

00:24:53 Will Donaghue: Yeah.

00:24:54 Moderator: So, do we have any questions from the audience?

00:25:04 Audience Member: Yes. You argue that you shouldn't just topple regimes you don't like. How do you respond to the fact that Venezuela was directly harming the United States through the drug trade, through human trafficking, through communist subversion of the United States of America?

00:25:21 Anthony Cacciato: Well I think there's a couple of things you have to establish in order to justify taking action. We can definitely look at whether or not there was direct harm being performed by the Venezuelan state against our people. Firstly, like I mentioned earlier, I think that if our government does come to the conclusion that Venezuela is attacking Americans through flooding our country with illegal drugs, through providing a launching pad for our enemies in the western hemisphere, I think that's the responsibility of our legislative branch to deliberate and then issue an Authorization for Use of Military Force to perform whatever sort of actions would be necessary to rectify that.

00:26:06 Anthony Cacciato: I think also what you need is a plan. Because ultimately we don't want to put ourselves in a position where again we are sinking American servicemen and service women into some sort of peacekeeping operation. And that doesn't really change whether or not it's on the other side of the Caribbean or on the other side of the Atlantic. We've seen this story happen before and we've seen these sorts of operations fall apart. I think the biggest concern is making sure that if we're even thinking about doing this, that we're doing it by the books, by the Constitution, and making sure we're doing so in a way where we're not sinking ourselves into one of those situations such as what we saw in the Middle East.

00:26:49 Moderator: Thank you. And I think we have time for one more question.

00:26:53 Audience Member 2: Me. Uh, okay. Mr. Donaghue, Anthony said something about governing by predator drone, and clearly that's not going to work. We don't know much about what's going to take place in the coming weeks and months, but the one thing that we're very clear about is that Mr. Trump has said there's going to be continued American involvement in that region, and that will mean boots on the ground at some point almost certainly, and that will mean the risking of American lives. How does that jibe with your proposal that this is in American interests? Is it in American interest to risk our service members' lives abroad, even in our own hemisphere?

00:27:27 Will Donaghue: So I think when we use the term "abroad," we typically don't mean in our own hemisphere, right? So it is "abroad" in the sense that it's no longer within the sovereign bounds of the United States. When we're talking about abroad, we're typically talking about the regions of Asia and Europe. Our hemisphere needs to be defended and troops should be on the ground in Venezuela. They should be in bases in Venezuela. They should be in bases in Chile. They should be in bases in El Salvador. We should not have any Chinese influence in any region of the Western Hemisphere. If that means that we put US bases in these regions, I'm totally for it. And I don't think US service members are going to be in danger in the same way that they were in danger in the Middle East. You are not going to have these terrorist factions constantly trying to bomb our service members and setting up IEDs all over the place. The Venezuelan people are very happy that the United States came in and liberated them. And I think the exact same thing will happen in Cuba as well. The United States should have bases all over the Western Hemisphere in order to protect us against Chinese influence and Chinese encroachment into our space. So I'm not afraid of putting [troops] in Venezuela. I don't think they're going to be under threat largely in the same way that they would be in Islamic-controlled states. And we should occupy this long term.
