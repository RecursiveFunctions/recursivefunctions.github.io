[00:00:00] THE INTRO
Moderator: Hello everyone. Thank you all for coming out to hear this amazing conversation on Venezuela. A little backstory: This started just after US forces were able to seize and arrest Nicholas Maduro for his crimes and bring him to justice in the United States. We've had a disagreement between Anthony and Will on this topic. We thought it would be appropriate because we are all on the same side, part of the same movement. I’m going to turn it over to Will and Anthony to open the conversation: Are the United States' actions against Venezuela justified? Are they good? Should we be following the "Don-Rogue" doctrine?

[00:01:21] THE CONSTITUTIONALITY ARGUMENT
Anthony (YAL): Thank you for having us. It's important to remember that we can disagree and still be on the same side. Having a free Venezuela—one free from the horrors of socialism, operating on free-market principles with self-determination is desirable. No one here is opposed to a free Venezuelan people. But we have to dig into the issues of how we get there.

Look at Iraq and Afghanistan; between those, there was a Congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). That is the important linchpin. Whether or not you agree with intervening, you have to do it by the Constitution. We are not a country of "whatever the last guy did." We are a country of laws. The AUMF is vested within the legislative branch. A system with checks and balances requires the input of our elected representatives in the legislature.

Will (Republican): I agree entirely that separation of powers is important. However, the legislature has implemented policy to allow the President—in matters relating to national security or the execution of police power—to engage in limited strikes against opponents abroad. Both the Left and Right have used this for drone strikes and assassinations multiple times.

This cannot be a drawn-out campaign; that obviously requires Congressional approval. But the President does have the authority in limited circumstances to bomb or assassinate world leaders, or abduct them at night—which is what we did to Maduro quite effectively. I think this was a clean execution of the President's police authority. This was an enforcement action, not an act of war. Maduro was not a legitimate leader, and his actions pushing drug cartels led to the deaths of potentially millions of Americans.

[00:09:21] JURISDICTION & THE EMPIRE
Anthony (YAL): Is Maduro liable for crimes against the American people and his own country? Absolutely. That needs to be put to rest. But the issue lies in the extent of United States jurisdiction. Do we have the legal jurisdiction to perform law enforcement tasks outside of our own country?

Will (Republican): The executive power is vested in the President. What is jurisdiction? What is force? These are matters of international law. The truth is, the only thing that matters in the state of nature is the use of force. There is no country on the planet that can compete with the United States military. If Canada or Greenland stood up to the US, they would be rolled over in minutes. There is nothing Europe, Russia, or China could do to stop us short of a nuclear bomb.

Therefore, the United States is the ultimate jurisdiction over the entire world. The sooner we realize that as an Empire, the sooner we can secure American peace. What is law? Law is words on a piece of paper that we mutually assure through the use of force. We are not signatories on the International Criminal Court for a reason: the only person that could enforce the law against us is us.

Anthony (YAL): I think we agree that international law isn't a binding force against the United States. But operating on that framework sets a dangerous precedent. It would be revisionist to assume the Monroe Doctrine operated as a carte blanche for the United States to have overlordship over the Western Hemisphere. It was an intentionality to exclude European colonial powers from influencing our hemisphere because there was a value in self-determination.

To presume we have authority over other nations simply because we have a military able to enforce it puts us in dangerous moral territory.

Will (Republican): I am not concerned with the moral territory. The ultimate moral territory that matters is the security of the American people. We are "America First." China is all over Central and South America—owning ports, mines, and waterways. This is a danger to the American people. I am not concerned about the morality of pushing around third-world nations in our hemisphere if it preserves the security of the American people.

[00:16:01] HISTORICAL CONTEXT
Will (Republican): Let's look at the history of our foreign policy. Up until 1947, we had the Spanish-American War and the Banana Wars. These were to secure American goods—sugar, bananas, coffee. They were highly successful military operations. 1947 changed everything. We became the world police. This led to a 30-year history of terrible conflicts: Bay of Pigs, Iran, Guatemala. Every time the CIA tried this covert nonsense, they failed.

We got smarter on two occasions: Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). The Panama invasion is largely regarded as the greatest conservative victory—a swift military ground invasion, no CIA involvement, American interests secured. Iraq was a messy failure because we tried to build democracies where they don't fit. Venezuela will be like Panama—quick and beneficial.

Anthony (YAL): I agree with 80% of that. The neocon policy of foreign intervention failed. But looking at Venezuela specifically, while we removed Maduro, his VP is now in charge. To what extent do we have influence over this VP? Did we go in with a plan?

When we go in with an unsteady plan, we risk having to do stabilization work, which is what happened in the Middle East. Even if we don't deploy an excessive amount of troops, we end up with a peacekeeping force. You cannot govern by Predator drone. You will have to put men and women on the ground.

[00:24:54] Q&A SECTION
Audience Member: Will, you say "America First," but putting troops in Venezuela risks American lives. How does that jibe?

Will (Republican): "Abroad" usually means Europe or Asia. The Americas are our backyard. Troops should be on the ground in Venezuela. They should be in bases in Venezuela, Chile, and El Salvador. We should not have any Chinese influence in the Western Hemisphere.

I don't think US service members will be in danger the same way they were in the Middle East. You won't have terrorist factions bombing service members or setting IEDs. The Venezuelan people are happy the United States liberated them. We should occupy this long-term.
